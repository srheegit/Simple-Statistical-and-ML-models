# Simple-Statistical-and-ML-models
The Repository is a compendium of various simple statistical and/or machine learning models, providing foundations of more complex models and projects.

The models and/or concepts that I have implemented in code so far are as follows:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Softmax regression
- Feature engineering (Polynomial regression)
- LOWESS and LOESS models
- Various Naiva Bayes Classification models: Gaussian, Multinomial, and Complement
- Gaussian Discriminant Analysis model
- Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
- Data Split
- Cross Validation
- Feature Selection (filter method, wrapper method, and embedded method)
- Neural Network using PyTorch

More will be uploaded after my polish.
